# Progressive Web Applications (PWA)

## Why PWA!
* Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are a new way to build web apps that are faster, more responsive, and more secure.
* PWAs can ensure applications work without an internet connection by using the Service Worker and Cache APIs to cache assets and API responses.

## Webpack
* Webpack is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
* Webpack helps in optimizations and bundle compressing assets.\

## IndexedDB
* IndexedDB is a database that stores data locally on the user's device.
  

## Workbox
* Workbox is a service worker that helps in caching assets and API responses.

# Client-Server Model
* Client-Server model is a model where the client communicates with the server.


## `Client`
 A client is any device that can communicate with a server and request information through a browser. This includes desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, iPads, smart televisions, gaming systems, and even an Alexa! 
 
 As the Internet of Things (IoT) expands to household appliances such as smart refrigerators or security cameras, the list of possible clients expands.

 ## `Server`
A server is a computer program or device that provides services using a request and response cycle to another device, which is known as the client. Servers are often housed within large data centers, but they can also be kept on-site and even on the same machine as the client.

The primary objective of any server is to wait and listen for incoming requests and then to respond with the appropriate data, much like the staff from our restaurant analogy!

## `Concurrently`
Concurrently is a term that refers to the fact that a server can respond to multiple requests at the same time.
the tool `Concurrently` will allow us to execute and run multiple commands simultaneously.
